# MCP server

`gog mcp` runs a Model Context Protocol server over stdio. It is for agent
clients that need Google Workspace tools but should not receive a generic shell
or arbitrary `gog` command bridge.

The server registers a small set of typed tools such as `gmail_search`,
`docs_get`, and `sheets_read_range`. Each tool has a fixed schema, maps to one
specific `gog` operation, and returns a structured result containing the tool
name, service, risk level, exit code, parsed stdout, and stderr.

## Quick start

Start a read-only server for one account:

```bash
gog --account you@example.com mcp
```

List the tools this server would expose and exit:

```bash
gog --account you@example.com mcp --list-tools
```

Limit the server to Gmail search and Docs reads:

```bash
gog --account you@example.com mcp \
  --allow-tool gmail_search,docs_get
```

Expose Docs read/write tools:

```bash
gog --account you@example.com mcp \
  --allow-write \
  --allow-tool 'docs.*'
```

Expose only Gmail draft creation and update:

```bash
gog --account you@example.com mcp \
  --allow-write \
  --allow-tool gmail_create_draft,gmail_update_draft
```

These tools can store or revise drafts but cannot send them. The MCP catalog
does not expose Gmail draft sending.

`--allow-write` is always required for write tools. A write tool that matches
`--allow-tool` is still hidden until `--allow-write` is present.

The exception is an explicit persistent MCP policy. It can authorize a narrow
write surface without repeating `--allow-write` in every client definition;
runtime flags can only reduce that configured surface.

## Why this is not `gog_exec`

MCP clients are often LLM-driven. A generic "run this command" tool would expose
every current and future CLI behavior through one broad capability, including
commands that were not reviewed for MCP use.

`gog mcp` uses a narrower contract:

- no generic command execution tool
- no model-supplied argv passthrough
- fixed tool schemas validated before command execution, including required
  fields, types, and rejection of unknown fields
- read-only tools by default
- write tools require explicit server startup flags
- existing `gog` account, auth, dry-run, no-input, and command safety flags are
  preserved

This keeps MCP useful for agents while making the permission surface visible at
server startup.

## Tool selection

By default, all read tools are registered and write tools are hidden.

Use `--allow-tool` to narrow the registered set. Values can be comma-separated
or repeated:

```bash
gog mcp --allow-tool gmail_search --allow-tool docs_get
gog mcp --allow-tool gmail_search,docs_get
```

Accepted selectors:

| Selector | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `gmail_search` | One exact tool |
| `gmail` | All Gmail tools allowed by risk mode |
| `gmail.*` | All Gmail tools allowed by risk mode |
| `read` | All read tools |
| `write` | All write tools, only when `--allow-write` is also set |
| `*` or `all` | All tools allowed by risk mode |

Service, risk, and wildcard selectors are intentionally open-ended within their
risk mode: adding a tool in a later release can expand a matching selector.
Use exact tool names when a persistent policy must remain fixed across upgrades.

Examples:

```bash
# Read-only Gmail tools.
gog mcp --allow-tool gmail

# Only Docs tools, including writes.
gog mcp --allow-write --allow-tool 'docs.*'

# Read-only server, but only Calendar and Sheets reads.
gog mcp --allow-tool calendar,sheets

# All current write tools. Read tools are not included unless also selected.
gog mcp --allow-write --allow-tool write
```

## Persistent capability policy

For several MCP clients or accounts, put the maximum registered tool surface in
`config.json` instead of duplicating capability arguments. Without an `mcp`
block, behavior is unchanged: all read tools are available, writes require
`--allow-write`, and `--allow-tool` filters the result.

```json5
{
  "mcp": {
    "allow_tools": ["read"],
    "allow_write": false,
    "accounts": {
      "personal@example.com": {
        "allow_tools": ["read", "docs.*", "calendar.*"],
        "allow_write": true
      },
      "work@example.com": {
        "allow_tools": ["read"],
        "allow_write": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

An account entry is a complete replacement for the global policy, not a partial
merge. Account keys are matched case-insensitively after aliases and automatic
account selection are resolved, then that resolved account is pinned for every
MCP child command. Per-account policies require stored account credentials;
direct access tokens and ADC can use only the global policy because an account
label does not prove the authenticated principal. An omitted `allow_tools` value defaults to
`["read"]`; an explicitly empty list is rejected. `allow_write: true` requires
an explicit tool list so a typo cannot accidentally expose every write tool.

The configured policy is a ceiling. `--allow-tool` can intersect it with a
smaller runtime set, `--readonly` removes all writes, and `--allow-write` cannot
widen a read-only policy. Baked safety profiles remain the outer immutable
ceiling. Unknown configured selectors and attempted write widening fail before
the MCP server starts. Use `gog mcp --list-tools` with the same account and flags
to inspect the final registered surface.

## Initial tools

Read tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `gmail_search` | Search Gmail messages with Gmail query syntax. |
| `gmail_get_message` | Read one Gmail message by ID. Sanitized content is on by default. |
| `gmail_get_thread` | Read one Gmail thread by ID. Sanitized content is on by default. |
| `drive_search` | Search Drive files by text or Drive query language. |
| `drive_get` | Read Drive file metadata by ID. |
| `docs_get` | Read a Google Doc as wrapped text, optionally one tab or all tabs. |
| `sheets_read_range` | Read values from a Sheets range. |
| `calendar_events` | List Calendar events. |

Write tools, hidden unless `--allow-write`:

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `docs_write` | Append or replace Google Docs text, optionally as Markdown. |
| `sheets_update_range` | Update values in a Sheets range from a literal JSON 2D array. |
| `gmail_create_draft` | Create an unsent Gmail draft from inline text or HTML. |
| `gmail_update_draft` | Update one unsent Gmail draft while preserving omitted recipients, attachments, and reply context. |

The generated command reference for the server itself is
[`gog mcp`](commands/gog-mcp.md).

MCP clients discover the registered surface through the protocol's standard
`tools/list` request. For shell-side inspection before starting the server, use
`gog mcp --list-tools`; no model-callable discovery tool is added.

## Client configuration

MCP clients usually need a command and an argument list. Put account selection
and safety policy on the server command, not inside tool calls.

Minimal stdio configuration:

```json
{
  "command": "gog",
  "args": ["--account", "you@example.com", "mcp"]
}
```

Read-only Docs and Sheets configuration:

```json
{
  "command": "gog",
  "args": [
    "--account", "you@example.com",
    "--enable-commands-exact", "mcp,docs.cat,sheets.get",
    "mcp",
    "--allow-tool", "docs_get,sheets_read_range"
  ]
}
```

Docs read/write configuration:

```json
{
  "command": "gog",
  "args": [
    "--account", "you@example.com",
    "--enable-commands-exact", "mcp,docs.cat,docs.write",
    "--no-input",
    "mcp",
    "--allow-write",
    "--allow-tool", "docs.*"
  ]
}
```

For headless services, set `GOG_KEYRING_BACKEND=file` and
`GOG_KEYRING_PASSWORD` on the MCP client process or service unit. A successful
interactive shell check does not prove the MCP client inherited those
variables; verify through the same process manager that launches the server.

## mcporter examples

List registered tools and their schemas:

```bash
mcporter list \
  --stdio gog \
  --stdio-arg --account \
  --stdio-arg you@example.com \
  --stdio-arg mcp \
  --stdio-arg --allow-tool \
  --stdio-arg 'docs.*' \
  --schema \
  --json
```

Dry-run a Docs write through MCP:

```bash
mcporter call \
  --stdio gog \
  --stdio-arg --account \
  --stdio-arg you@example.com \
  --stdio-arg --dry-run \
  --stdio-arg mcp \
  --stdio-arg --allow-write \
  --stdio-arg --allow-tool \
  --stdio-arg docs_write \
  docs_write \
  '{"document_id":"DOCUMENT_ID","text":"MCP smoke test\n","append":true}'
```

Read a Sheet range:

```bash
mcporter call \
  --stdio gog \
  --stdio-arg --account \
  --stdio-arg you@example.com \
  --stdio-arg mcp \
  --stdio-arg --allow-tool \
  --stdio-arg sheets_read_range \
  sheets_read_range \
  '{"spreadsheet_id":"SPREADSHEET_ID","range":"Sheet1!A1:C10"}'
```

Update a Sheet range:

```bash
mcporter call \
  --stdio gog \
  --stdio-arg --account \
  --stdio-arg you@example.com \
  --stdio-arg mcp \
  --stdio-arg --allow-write \
  --stdio-arg --allow-tool \
  --stdio-arg sheets_update_range \
  sheets_update_range \
  '{"spreadsheet_id":"SPREADSHEET_ID","range":"Sheet1!A1:B1","values_json":"[[\"status\",\"ok\"]]","input":"RAW"}'
```

`sheets_update_range.values_json` must be literal JSON. MCP rejects `@file`,
`@-`, and `-` expansion forms so a model cannot cause the server process to
read arbitrary local files or stdin.

Create an unsent Gmail draft:

```bash
mcporter call \
  --stdio gog \
  --stdio-arg --account \
  --stdio-arg you@example.com \
  --stdio-arg mcp \
  --stdio-arg --allow-write \
  --stdio-arg --allow-tool \
  --stdio-arg gmail_create_draft \
  gmail_create_draft \
  '{"subject":"Review notes","body":"Draft only; not sent."}'
```

Draft tools accept inline `body` or `body_html` content only. They do not
accept file paths, stdin, attachments, arbitrary arguments, or send actions.
Both tools require inline text or HTML. Updates also require `subject` unless
`reply_to_message_id` or `thread_id` supplies reply context.

## Safety model

Tool calls run as subprocesses of the same `gog` executable. The server adds a
non-interactive, agent-oriented root context to every child command:

- `--json`
- `--wrap-untrusted`
- `--no-input`
- `--color=never`

The server also preserves selected parent root flags:

- `--account`
- `--client`
- `--home`
- `--dry-run`
- `--results-only`
- `--select`
- direct access tokens

And it preserves command safety flags:

- `--gmail-no-send`
- `--enable-commands`
- `--enable-commands-exact`
- `--disable-commands`

Use both MCP tool allowlists and command allowlists when the server is exposed
to an untrusted or semi-trusted agent:

```bash
gog --account you@example.com \
  --enable-commands-exact mcp,docs.cat,docs.write \
  --disable-commands gmail.send,gmail.drafts.send \
  --gmail-no-send \
  mcp \
  --allow-write \
  --allow-tool 'docs.*'
```

If a tool maps to a disabled command, the tool call returns a non-zero exit code
and the child command error in `stderr`.

## Output shape

Successful calls return structured MCP content shaped like:

```json
{
  "tool": "docs_get",
  "service": "docs",
  "risk": "read",
  "exit_code": 0,
  "stdout": {
    "documentId": "..."
  },
  "stderr": ""
}
```

If a child command prints valid JSON, `stdout` is parsed as JSON with numeric
literals preserved. Otherwise `stdout` is returned as a string. Empty stdout is
omitted.

If the child command exits non-zero, the MCP result is marked as an error and
includes the same structured fields with `exit_code` and `stderr`.

## Limits and timeouts

Each tool call has a subprocess timeout and bounded stdout/stderr capture:

```bash
gog mcp --timeout-seconds 30 --max-output-bytes 262144
```

Defaults:

- timeout: 60 seconds
- max captured stdout/stderr: 102400 bytes each

Use command-specific limits too. For example, `docs_get` has a `max_bytes`
argument, and search tools have `max` arguments.

## Authentication

The MCP server uses normal `gog` auth. Before wiring a client, verify the same
account and scopes from a shell:

```bash
gog --account you@example.com auth doctor --check
gog --account you@example.com mcp --list-tools
```

Then verify through the MCP client entrypoint. In services and desktop MCP
clients, most auth failures are environment inheritance problems: missing
`GOG_ACCOUNT`, missing file-keyring password, different `GOG_HOME`, or a
different OAuth client selected by `--client`.

## Troubleshooting

`no MCP tools enabled`

: Your `--allow-tool` filters excluded everything, or you selected only write
  tools without `--allow-write`.

`command "..." is disabled`

: The MCP tool was registered, but the child `gog` command was blocked by
  `--enable-commands`, `--enable-commands-exact`, `--disable-commands`, or a
  baked safety profile.

Tool missing in the client

: Run `gog mcp --list-tools` with the same flags. If the tool is not listed,
  fix `--allow-tool` or add `--allow-write` for write tools. If it is listed,
  refresh or restart the MCP client.

Auth works in Terminal but not in the MCP client

: Compare `--account`, `--client`, `--home`, `GOG_HOME`,
  `GOG_KEYRING_BACKEND`, and `GOG_KEYRING_PASSWORD` in the process that starts
  the MCP server.

Large output is truncated

: Increase `--max-output-bytes`, narrow the request, or use tool arguments such
  as `max`, `max_bytes`, date ranges, or Drive field masks.
