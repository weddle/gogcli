# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Dependencies: update the Go developer tools, pnpm, and email-tracking worker transitive pins to their latest releases.
- Docs: rewrite the README as a concise front door and move task examples into a dedicated guide.
- MCP: reject explicitly empty `docs_write` tabs before execution and preserve exact argv for append, replace, markdown, tab, and leading-dash text inputs.
- MCP: expose the existing Sheets `dimension` enum (`ROWS`/`COLUMNS`) on `sheets_read_range`, preserving the default and exact `--`-delimited range argv.
- MCP: add default read-only `drive_list_folder` with bounded folder paging and explicit shared-drive inclusion over `drive ls`.
- MCP: add optional typed `drive_search.drive_id` shared-drive scoping via the existing `--drive` flag; paging and `all_drives` toggles remain outside the MCP surface.
- MCP: add typed, bounded `calendar_events` paging with opaque `page_token`, explicit `all_pages`, mutual-exclusion validation, and preserved API page envelopes.
- MCP: add `gmail_update_draft` as an ordinary Write tool over the existing full-message-rebuild CLI path: omitted `to` is preserved, omitted `cc`/`bcc` are cleared unless reply-all derives them, attachments and reply lineage are preserved, and send, file, attachment-change, path, or generic argv inputs remain excluded.
- MCP: register the explicitly authorized destructive `gmail_delete_draft` tool
  with a closed `draft_id` schema and server-controlled `--force`; drafts are
  permanently deleted and are not recoverable from Trash.
- MCP: add `calendar_update_event` as an ordinary Write tool with explicit partial-update presence semantics, serialized clears for supported empty summary/description/location/attendees/rrule/reminders/event-color fields, recurring-event scope, and `send_updates=none` by default; integrations, attachments, and specialized Calendar event types remain excluded.
- Drive: add a shared `--max-bytes` raw-content cap to download/export, with inclusive boundary detection and fail-closed temporary output cleanup.
- MCP: register explicitly authorized destructive `calendar_delete_event` with
  required calendar/event IDs and recurrence scope, conditional
  `original_start`, safe `send_updates=none` default, server-controlled
  `--force`, and a closed schema; whole-calendar deletion remains excluded.
  Future-scope deletion precomputes recurrence changes before deleting, and a
  subsequent parent-patch failure returns non-zero with the deleted instance
  and parent IDs plus `seriesUpdated=false` for manual read-back and repair;
  blind retry is unsafe.
- MCP: register destructive `gmail_trash_messages` with a closed, bounded
  1–1,000 explicit-message-ID schema and one aggregate `BatchModify` request.
  It preserves recoverable Gmail Trash behavior, exposes aggregate
  action/count/label output plus a typed error envelope on provider failure,
  and never fabricates per-item evidence. Query/max, thread,
  permanent-delete, force, and generic argv inputs remain excluded. Ordinary
  message/thread label tools reject adding `TRASH`, preventing a bypass of
  explicit destructive authorization and leaving thread trash unavailable.
- MCP: register destructive `drive_share_user` with a closed user-only grant
  schema (`file_id`, plain email, and reader/commenter/writer role defaulting
  to reader); target, notification, and discoverability controls are fixed.
- MCP/Drive: preserve the created `permissionId` and permission evidence when
  `drive_share_user` creates a grant but its follow-up web-link lookup fails.
  The provider error and non-zero MCP status remain visible; the operation is
  documented as a non-atomic residual grant with exact-ID `drive_unshare`
  cleanup, and no compensation delete obscures the original failure.
- MCP: register destructive `drive_unshare` with a closed
  `file_id`/`permission_id` schema, server-controlled `--force`, exact
  permission-only argv, and the V02 read-before-mutation workflow.
- MCP: add fail-closed destructive authorization infrastructure. Destructive
  tools require ordinary write authorization plus an explicit `destructive` or
  exact-tool selector; broad Read/Write selectors never acquire X01–X06.
- MCP: register the `drive_trash` Destructive tool. It accepts only an
  explicit `file_id`, invokes default Drive trashing with server-controlled
  `--force`, and keeps permanent deletion, path, stdin, and generic argv
  inputs out of the closed schema.
- MCP: document the final Wave D registry snapshot (54 typed tools: 19 Read,
  29 ordinary Write, and 6 Destructive), future-expanding ordinary selectors,
  and the bounded B04 Drive download Read surface. Gmail send/permanent message
  deletion, Drive upload/permanent deletion, and whole-calendar deletion remain
  excluded.
- Sheets/MCP: document concrete-A1 row and column overflow rejection for
  literal `values_json` while preserving strict JSON, numeric precision, and
  named/open-ended range compatibility.
- MCP: record E03's explicit exclusion of Drive permanent delete, upload, host
  paths, stdin, and `@file` transport, while retaining the narrow destructive
  trash/share-user/unshare contracts and B01's bounded inline-base64 decision.
- MCP: implement the reusable bounded inline binary encoder selected by B01,
  with padded standard base64, direct structured content, MIME/name/size
  metadata, a 65,536-byte inclusive raw cap, and atomic output-cap errors.
- MCP: register the bounded `drive_download` Read tool over the B02/B03
  transport. It accepts only explicit `file_id` plus supported `format`,
  uses fixed server-side raw capture, and never returns a host path or partial
  base64.
- MCP: document tool-specific bounds/defaults and structured partial-failure
  hazards for non-atomic Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Gmail archive/thread/label
  operations; X03 trash uses one aggregate `BatchModify` request per bounded
  MCP call.
- MCP: document C10's out-of-band cleanup: create the secondary calendar,
  record its returned calendar ID, then run `gog calendar delete-calendar CALENDAR_ID`.
  Also disclose C05's CLI detection order and non-global sorting, plus V06's
  source pre-read and shallow folder-copy semantics.

## 0.31.0 - 2026-06-24

- Gmail: preserve HTML fragments from `--signature-file` instead of escaping their markup, without broadening HTML detection for message display or reply quoting. (#879) — thanks @kesslerio.
- Docs: honor `--tab` when setting document layout so `page-layout --tab` (and `write --pageless --tab`) target the specified tab instead of always the default tab. Page layout is per-tab; previously these silently no-opped on secondary tabs of multi-tab documents. (#878) — thanks @atmasphere.
- Auth: recover from corrupt stored OAuth token payloads by routing only classified decode corruption through the normal re-authentication flow while preserving operational keyring errors. (#872, #874) — thanks @KrasimirKralev.

- Auth: add `auth setup` for guided Google Cloud project/API preparation, OAuth client installation, and optional browser authorization.
- API: add Discovery-backed `api list`, `api describe`, and scoped `api call` access for Google methods outside the first-class command surface, with dry-run plans and explicit write opt-in.
- Safety: add global `--readonly` / `GOG_READONLY=1` runtime enforcement that blocks mutating Google and Zoom API requests before dispatch while preserving read-only query POSTs and least-privilege OAuth setup.
- Add schema-generated service skills and curated agent workflows for inbox triage, meeting prep, attachment archival, Drive audits, weekly digests, and contact cleanup.
- Docs: sharpen the README and overview around task-first workflows, predictable automation, identity routing, layered agent safety, and honest product boundaries.

## 0.30.0 - 2026-06-21

### Added

- Sheets: add structured formula-error verification to `sheets update --fail-on-formula-error`, using exact updated-range grid data and canonical `--values-json @file` input. (#849) — thanks @alexknowshtml.
- Docs: add first-class footnote, section-break, horizontal-rule, and section-column commands with shared index, anchor, tab, dry-run, and batch behavior where supported. (#856) — thanks @sebsnyk.

- Docs: add `insert --markdown` to convert markdown to Google Docs formatting and place the converted block at a position resolved by `--index`/`--at`/`--occurrence`, giving `insert` parity with the existing `update --markdown` and `write --markdown` paths. (#851, #854) — thanks @sebsnyk.

## 0.29.0 - 2026-06-19

### Added

### Fixed

- Docs: preserve the matched paragraph's list or heading structure on the first plain paragraph of a block Markdown replacement. (#838) — thanks @sebsnyk.
- Calendar: report multi-calendar event truncation on stderr for text output and as per-calendar page tokens in JSON. (#831) — thanks @TurboTheTurtle.

- Docs: update the Docker authentication example to persist file-keyring tokens with `GOG_HOME`. (#828, #830) — thanks @WadydX.

## 0.28.0 - 2026-06-15

### Added

- Contacts: add guarded `contacts dedupe --apply` merging with exact dry-run plans, repeatable `--resource` scoping, confirmation, full updatable-field preservation, etag checks before deletion, and refusal of ambiguous or unmergeable groups. (#815) — thanks @privatenumber.
- Docs: expose heading IDs in `docs headings list --json` and `docs paragraphs list --json` for building in-document deep links. (#819, #820) — thanks @sebsnyk.

### Changed

- Gmail: show ordinary message bodies in full by default in text output, retain a generous cap for unusually large messages, and point truncated output to `--full` or `--json`. (#807) — thanks @privatenumber.

## 0.27.1 - 2026-06-15

### Fixed

- Calendar: accept relative and date-only `freebusy --from`/`--to` values using the same timezone-aware range parsing as events. (#806, #811) — thanks @privatenumber.
- Gmail: add `--reply-all` to draft create and update so reply drafts can infer original recipients while preserving explicit recipient overrides. (#804, #805) — thanks @privatenumber.
- Gmail: make truncated text bodies point to `--full` or `--json` and align thread help with full-body behavior. (#807, #809) — thanks @privatenumber.
- CLI: mention `--all` or `--all-pages` in next-page hints while retaining page-token guidance. (#808, #810) — thanks @privatenumber.
- Docs: validate local Markdown heading anchors during docs coverage checks, including Unicode and encoded fragments. (#812) — thanks @kiranmagic7.

## 0.27.0 - 2026-06-14

### Added

- Gmail: add first-class `gmail reply` and `gmail reply-all` commands with inherited `Re:` subjects, quoted originals by default, preserved display names and CID inline images, additive recipient placement, automatic moves between To/Cc/Bcc, and repeatable `--remove`; reply-mode `gmail send` also inherits omitted subjects, while forwards preserve inline images without incorrectly claiming the original reply thread.
- YouTube: add `playlists items list` for public and private playlist contents with pagination, and `videos list --my-rating like|dislike` for authenticated rating history. (#787) — thanks @coeur-de-loup.

### Fixed

- Docs: reject ambiguous `docs cat --tab ... --all-tabs` and MCP `docs_get` requests before contacting the Docs API. (#801) — thanks @kiranmagic7.

## 0.26.0 - 2026-06-14

### Added

- YouTube: add subscription listing and management plus playlist create, add, remove, and delete commands with least-privilege OAuth, dry-run support, structured output, and destructive-operation confirmation. (#767) — thanks @beezly.
- Calendar: add `unsubscribe` for removing calendar-list entries and `delete-calendar` for deleting owned secondary calendars, with dry-run, confirmation, and structured output.

### Fixed

- Contacts: remove the nonfunctional `contacts other delete` command; the public People API has no delete operation for Other Contacts, and its copy-then-delete workaround reported success without removing the source. Existing invocations now return unknown-command usage.
- Meet: return empty history and participant collections as JSON arrays, and make `participants --fail-empty` control the no-conference exit instead of misclassifying it as invalid usage.
- MCP: validate typed tool calls against their closed schemas before command execution, rejecting unknown fields, wrong types, and missing required fields.
- CLI: classify malformed OAuth token imports as usage errors and missing Gmail tracking setup as configuration errors.
- CLI: classify invalid Docs batch IDs and incomplete Gmail filter definitions as usage errors with exit code 2.
- Docs: keep batch list/show, batch target validation, and batch end dry-runs read-only without creating state directories or lock files.
- Docs: persist successful split and individual batch submissions before reporting a missing response revision, preventing retries from submitting already-applied requests again.
- Gmail: make `watch status` read atomic watch state without creating state directories or lock files.
- Gmail: make `watch serve --dry-run` return a secret-free daemon plan without creating/locking/updating watch state, saving hook settings, creating clients, or opening a socket.
- Backup: make status, verify, cat, and export use read-only repository setup and file-free dry-run plans, support pre-created empty repository directories, keep failed clones clean, disable Git credential prompts under `--no-input`, redact credentials from Git errors, preserve clone failures instead of initializing a new repository, and give status/verify the existing `--no-pull` flags while retaining hidden compatibility for legacy write-only options.
- Auth: make `auth manage --dry-run` preview the browser flow without touching the keyring or server, and fail fast when real execution uses `--no-input`.
- Docs: make `docs cell-style` table, row, and column coordinates one-based like adjacent table commands, with negative table indexes counting from the end.
- Docs: make positional `docs sed` image selectors deterministic by ordering anchored positioned images with document content and unanchored positioned images by object ID.
- Docs: make addressed `docs sed` substitutions honor nth-match flags, use UTF-16 document indices, and ignore table or table-of-contents preview text instead of producing invalid mutation ranges.
- Docs: keep `docs sed` formatting, footnote, break, and structural targets aligned when earlier image or text replacements change document length.
- Docs: avoid overlapping deletes when a `docs sed` addressed range includes the final paragraph.
- Docs: make `docs sed` table-cell substitutions use UTF-16 indices, honor nth-match flags, expand captures independently per wildcard cell, refetch before repeated same-cell expressions, and report the exact replacement count.
- Docs: make `docs sed` table-creation placeholders use UTF-16 indices and share cell-fill Markdown range planning with table-cell replacement.
- Docs: validate unaddressed `docs sed` delete/insert/append regexes before fetching and keep their top-level paragraph selection and reverse mutation ordering consistent with addressed commands.
- Auth: clarify that `auth import` always requires a refresh-token source and only optionally accepts a current access token plus expiry.
- Calendar: make alias set/unset dry-runs preview config changes without writing `config.json`.
- Dry-run safety: keep Drive, Contacts, Slides thumbnail, backup plaintext, OAuth token, Gmail filter, Photos, and Photos Picker downloads/exports offline and prevent local file or secret output.
- Auth: make `auth credentials set --dry-run` preview credential and domain writes without opening the keyring or changing files, and validate every domain before storing credentials.
- CLI: replace the stale hard-coded `--account` service list with concise email, alias, and auto-selection guidance that applies across authenticated Google API commands.
- Calendar: remove the dead `calendar appointments` command, which could only report an API limitation; existing invocations now return unknown-command usage, while the limitation remains documented.
- Drive: preserve repeated folder placements in tree, inventory, and size summaries; reject cyclic folder graphs instead of collapsing paths or scanning indefinitely.
- Backup: bind configuration, legacy fallback, and home expansion to the selected runtime layout instead of process-global path state.
- Backup: require the exact Gmail message selection and run identity before reusing or promoting encrypted checkpoints, preventing stale same-count mailbox checkpoints from becoming the completed snapshot.
- Classroom: require an archived course before deletion with actionable lifecycle guidance, and prevent live tests from leaving consumer-account courses behind.
- Classroom: wait for course state changes to become readable before reporting success, so immediate archive-then-delete workflows do not fail on stale state.
- Forms: validate scale question bounds locally and document the Forms API's accepted minimum and maximum values.
- Groups and Calendar team: reject consumer accounts and stored user OAuth before Cloud Identity API calls, require an explicit account for identity-based direct-token/ADC searches, keep ADC precedence consistent across services, and provide recovery guidance for service-account, direct-token, and ADC auth.
- Gmail: bind watch state to the selected runtime state directory and serialize atomic updates across concurrent watch processes.
- Gmail: bind tracking configuration to the selected runtime state directory and preserve concurrent account updates with shared atomic locking.
- Gmail: bind tracking encryption and admin keys to the active runtime secret store instead of reopening the ambient keyring.
- Auth: avoid repeated macOS Keychain prompts during token export and auth listing by keeping exports read-only and stopping fallback reads after keyring timeouts. (#772) — thanks @lox.
- Gmail: add `--body-html-file` to draft create and update, including stdin support, for parity with send. (#774, #776) — thanks @TurboTheTurtle.
- Zoom: bind credential metadata and encrypted secret/token storage to the selected runtime layout, with consistent alias canonicalization.
- Auth: bind temporary manual OAuth state to the selected runtime config directory and reject unsafe redirect state values before filesystem access.
- Auth: bind renamed-account alias, client, and default-account migration to the active runtime config store.
- Auth: bind OAuth client credential commands to the active runtime secret store instead of reopening the ambient keyring.
- Auth: bind Google API and OAuth flows to the active runtime credential and token repositories instead of reopening ambient config and keyring state.
- Auth: capture keyring backend, password, service, platform, D-Bus, terminal, and lock policy once per runtime instead of rereading ambient process state.
- Auth: bind service-account lookup, storage, listing, and legacy Keep fallback to the active runtime repository; bound raw legacy paths and treat case-insensitive same-principal Keep credentials as pure service-account auth.
- Time: honor the runtime-selected `default_timezone` in `time now`, Gmail timestamps, watch output, Calendar time, and generated email Date headers instead of reading ambient config.
- Config: bind account and calendar alias management and resolution to the active runtime config store.
- Docs: document publishing personal External OAuth apps before authorization to avoid Google's seven-day Testing refresh-token expiry.

## 0.25.0 - 2026-06-12

### Added

- Photos: add an explicit-opt-in Google Photos Picker workflow for creating selection sessions, waiting for completion, listing chosen media, and downloading selected files. (#754)
- Docs: add persisted, revision-locked request batches for composing supported mutations locally and submitting them atomically, with explicit split and partial-recovery modes. (#755)
- CLI: remove the separate `gog agent` and `exit-codes` helpers; expose stable exit codes and effective automation safety state through `gog schema --json`, and summarize the contract in root help. (#677)
- CLI: add Git-style `gog help <command>`, make explicit output flags override environment defaults, validate color and JSON-only transforms before command execution, report early usage errors on stderr, and reject contradictory schema plain output.
- Docs: prevent multi-paragraph Markdown range replacements from inheriting the matched paragraph's heading or list style. (#756) — thanks @sebsnyk.
- Docs: preserve nested Markdown list levels as native bullets inside imported and updated table cells. (#749) — thanks @sebsnyk.
- Gmail: add explicit `gmail archive --thread` semantics so IDs from thread search can archive every message in each thread. (#752) — thanks @sebsnyk.
- Drive/Docs: add persisted polling for Drive changes and Docs comments, with bounded runs, filters, retry-safe cursors, and sequential JSON hooks. (#690, #751)
- Drive: expose shortcut targets in JSON and human-readable folder reports without changing stable `--plain` columns, classify shortcuts distinctly, keep tree scans from following folder targets, and add `drive shortcut create`. (#763)
- Drive: add a secure push-notification receiver with persisted cursors, authenticated callbacks, sequential hooks, and optional channel auto-renewal. (#689, #764)

### Fixed

- Gmail: preflight the broader OAuth grant required by permanent batch deletion and report an exact reauthorization command instead of a generic API 403.
- CLI: classify Photos Library, Photos Picker, and Places HTTP failures with the documented stable exit codes instead of generic exit code 1.

- Docs: recognize valid one-column Markdown tables, while preserving separator-shaped rows after the delimiter as table data.
- Docs: scope default-tab named-range replace and delete requests correctly in multi-tab documents.
- Forms: serialize `--quiz=false` explicitly so updating a form can disable quiz mode.

## 0.24.0 - 2026-06-11

### Added

- Calendar: add repeatable `--attachment` to `calendar update` for replacing or clearing event attachments. (#738) — thanks @TreyLawrence.

- Docs: add `docs insert-image --url` for inserting public HTTPS images directly without Drive upload or temporary public sharing. (#675) — thanks @sebsnyk.
- Docs: expose paragraph emptiness and text-run ranges, styles, and links in `docs paragraphs list --json`. (#734) — thanks @sebsnyk.
- Docs: add opt-in `--check-orphans` to Markdown replacement writes so open comments whose quoted text would disappear block the mutation with orphaned exit code 11. (#691) — thanks @sebsnyk.
- Drive: add `drive revisions list|get` for paged revision metadata and provider export links. (#672) — thanks @aaroneden.

### Fixed

- Auth: bind browser, manual, remote, and account-manager OAuth exchanges with S256 PKCE; unfinished pre-PKCE manual flows must restart at step 1. (#693, #725) — thanks @TurboTheTurtle.
- Docs: reset inherited text styles before applying Markdown find-replace formatting so leading bold spans and later inline styles stay paired correctly. (#735) — thanks @sebsnyk.
- Docs: accept leading-dash Markdown list values in `docs cell-update --content` and reject nonempty Markdown that produces no editable cell text. (#733) — thanks @sebsnyk.
- Docs: keep inline Markdown find-replace fragments inside their existing paragraph unless the replacement explicitly ends with a newline. (#736) — thanks @sebsnyk.
- Docs: render HTML `<br>` variants as line breaks inside Markdown table cells while preserving protected literals. (#730) — thanks @sebsnyk.

- Docs: add `--link` and `--no-link` to `docs format` for setting or clearing hyperlinks on matched text. (#684) — thanks @sebsnyk.
- Sheets: add `sheets links set` to write single-cell, multi-link rich-text, and batch hyperlinks. (#713) — thanks @chrischall.
- Slides: add `slides insert-image` to place a positioned, sized local image on an existing slide. (#695) — thanks @Czaruno.

### Fixed

- Docs: avoid duplicate empty paragraphs around Markdown tables written into a specific tab. (#715) — thanks @sebsnyk.
- Sheets: prevent accidental table data loss by requiring explicit `--discard-data` for `sheets table delete`, matching the Sheets API's destructive table-delete semantics. (#709) — thanks @chrischall.

## 0.22.0 - 2026-06-07

### Added

- Docs: add `--code` to `docs format` and plain-text `docs write` for the existing monospace grey code style. (#685) — thanks @sebsnyk.
- Drive/Docs: add `--since` to `drive comments list` and `docs comments list` for server-side comment modified-time filtering. (#688) — thanks @sebsnyk.
- Gmail: add `--thread-id` to `gmail drafts create` and `gmail drafts update` so drafts can reply within a thread using the latest message headers. (#673, #674) — thanks @chrischall.

### Fixed

- Docs: preserve nested list levels when writing markdown into a specific tab with `docs write --replace --markdown --tab`. (#696)
- Docs: fix `docs export --tab` tab resolution against the live Docs API field mask. (#696)
- Docs: strip Pandoc-style explicit heading anchors like `{#slug}` from rendered markdown headings and resolve matching same-document links. (#703)
- Docs: render GFM `~~strikethrough~~` spans in the local markdown writer used by `docs write --tab --markdown`. (#702)
- Docs: batch table-cell writes for `docs write --tab --markdown` to avoid per-cell Docs API quota bursts on table-heavy documents. (#699) — thanks @sebsnyk.
- Gmail: preserve existing `gmail drafts update` attachments when `--attach` is omitted, add `--clear-attachments` for intentional removal, and keep `--attach` as explicit replacement. (#680, #681) — thanks @chrischall.

## 0.21.0 - 2026-06-01

### Added

- MCP: add a typed, allowlisted `gog mcp` stdio server with read-only defaults and explicit write-tool opt-in. (#637) — thanks @auroracapital.
- Docs: add `docs table-column-width` to set fixed native table column widths or reset columns to evenly distributed sizing. (#631) — thanks @sebsnyk.

### Fixed

- Agent/MCP: fix command-allowlist docs so examples include `mcp`, keep wildcard tool selectors shell-safe, and report public dry-run op paths for service-account, Calendar, Forms, Meet, Sheets named ranges, and Docs/Sheets/Slides copy commands.
- Auth/credentials: return usage errors for unknown `--services` values and invalid service-account key JSON, keep `auth keep --dry-run` file-free, and make `zoom auth setup --dry-run` emit a redacted no-write plan.
- Backup/config: make backup init/export/push validation fail before repository or OAuth side effects, keep `backup init --dry-run` and `--no-push` offline/local-only, preserve semantic manifest counts during verify/export, and return usage errors for invalid config keys or values.
- CLI: preserve command-local `--fields` API masks, keep `open --type` shortcuts from rewriting unsupported URLs into malformed Google editor links, and stop advertising `ads` as an API command service while retaining it as an auth-only scope.
- Validation: consistently return usage exit code 2 before auth, API-key lookup, dry-run success, or mutation for invalid list limits, empty IDs/queries, malformed dates/timezones/recurrence, invalid enum flags, invalid resource paths, malformed JSON, unsupported formats, immutable labels, and unsafe local-file Markdown image references across Admin, Calendar, Chat, Contacts, Docs, Drive, Drive Activity, Drive Labels, Forms, Gmail, Groups, Keep, Maps, People, Photos, Search Console, Sheets, Slides, Tasks, Time, and YouTube.
- Dry-run safety: validate Gmail/Contacts/Chat/Admin email inputs, Drive share targets, Drive changes watch URLs/expiration, Docs comment anchors, Sheets chart anchors/ranges, and Search Console sitemap URLs before reporting dry-run success.
- JSON output: return empty arrays instead of null for empty Calendar conflicts, Classroom lists, Forms responses/watches, Gmail settings/filter/thread-attachment results, People relations, blank Sheets ranges, blank Slides text/image lists, and empty YouTube list responses.
- Calendar: make `calendar conflicts` check all calendars by default, reject explicit one-calendar conflict checks, reject unsupported all-day/date-only Out of Office payloads locally, and return usage errors when response/propose-time actions cannot be applied.
- Contacts: warm the People API contact-search cache before contact, other-contact, and Gmail `--from-contact` searches; resolve `contacts raw <email>` and `people raw <email>` to contact resources; and use an other-contact-safe read mask for other-contact list/search.
- Classroom: reject unfiltered `classroom invitations list` locally, report the canonical hyphenated dry-run op for `guardian-invitations create`, and normalize empty list output.
- Docs: validate `docs sed`, `docs cell-style`, and `docs table-column-width` table targets locally; reject malformed sed expressions; and fail Markdown writes with local image references that must be public HTTPS URLs.
- Drive: validate download/export/upload combinations before API calls, validate comment/permission limits, validate reporting/audit/bulk scan bounds, and reject invalid Drive Label field values including fractional integers, malformed dates/users, malformed `--fields-json`, and trailing JSON tokens.
- Gmail: validate vacation, auto-forward, forwarding, send-as, delegation, filter forwarding, compose headers, message formats, batch-modify labels, history cursors, tracked-send setup options, and immutable label operations locally; keep `gmail track setup --dry-run` offline and make tracking setup/status/key rotation honor `--json` without leaking generated secrets.
- Maps: validate mode, units, and reverse-geocode coordinates before API-key lookup, and share a generic Maps/Places API-key setup error with Calendar Places commands.
- Sheets: infer `sheets format --format-fields` from `--format-json`, validate update/append/table values and JSON specs locally, reject invalid field masks/ranges/anchors/type flags, and reject explicit negative freeze counts instead of treating `-1` as an unset sentinel.
- Slides: make local-image insertion/replacement use stable Drive download URLs and retry while sharing propagates, avoid invalid speaker-notes `deleteText` requests on blank notes pages, make notes/slide deletion commands return valid JSON, and require `--force` for non-interactive slide deletion.
- YouTube: let `activities list --channel-id`, `playlists list --channel-id`, and `channels list --id` honor `--account` OAuth; filter `youtube search list --type` to requested resource kinds; and validate blank IDs/type lists/chart regions before auth or API-key setup.

## 0.20.0 - 2026-05-30

### Fixed

- Gmail: keep label IDs case-sensitive during label resolution and duplicate-name checks while still matching label names case-insensitively.
- Gmail: clarify that `gmail drafts delete` permanently deletes drafts and cannot be recovered. (#656, #659) — thanks @chrischall.
- Sheets: add `--inherit-from-before` to `sheets insert` so callers can choose whether inserted rows/columns inherit formatting from the preceding or following neighbor. (#655, #658) — thanks @chrischall.
- Sheets: add `sheets copy-paste` / `fill` for range-level CopyPasteRequest fills of values, formulas, formatting, and related paste types. (#661, #663) — thanks @chrischall.
- CLI: add `--enable-commands-exact` / `GOG_ENABLE_COMMANDS_EXACT` for strict command allowlists without prefix expansion. (#652) — thanks @jason-allen-oneal.
- Auth: update stored OAuth scope metadata from observed granted scopes during refresh so `auth list` reflects newly usable services. (#649)
- Docs: preserve paragraph-separating blank lines when replacing a single tab from Markdown. (#644)
- Docs: add `docs cell-update` for non-destructive table-cell content replacement by table, row, and column. (#646)
- Docs: add `docs update --markdown` and `--replace-range` for formatted insertion and range replacement. (#642) — thanks @rel.
- Gmail: pause watch push Gmail API fetches per account while a 429 Retry-After circuit is open. (#643)
- YouTube: let `videos list` and `comments list` use OAuth when `--account` is supplied, preserving the API-key fallback for unauthenticated public reads. (#664)
- YouTube: add `youtube search list` / `yt search ls` for YouTube Data API search across videos, channels, and playlists. (#650, #651) — thanks @BRO3886.
- Gmail: add `gmail search --from-contact` to resolve a contact's email addresses into a `from:(...)` OR query. (#657) — thanks @chrischall.
- Docs: add named `--page-size` presets for `docs write` and `docs page-layout`. (#640) — thanks @sebsnyk.
- Docs: add smart-chip insertion commands for person, Drive file, and date chips. (#638) — thanks @sebsnyk.
- Docs: add `docs cell-style` for table-cell background color and inline cell text styling. (#645) — thanks @sebsnyk.
- Docs: add `docs insert-image` to upload a local image, temporarily share it for Docs insertion, and revoke the public permission afterward. (#648) — thanks @sebsnyk.
- Docs: update the bundled `gog` agent skill to preserve broad user OAuth scopes during reauth and rely on command guards for scoped execution.

## 0.19.0 - 2026-05-22

### Added

- Auth: store Google OAuth `client_secret` values in the keyring by default while leaving only client metadata on disk; legacy plaintext credentials still read and `auth credentials set --insecure` preserves the old write shape. (#596)
- Auth: add `auth credentials set --expand-env` for strict environment placeholder expansion in OAuth client JSON. (#599)
- Auth: let `auth import` seed an initial access token and expiry, and round-trip cached access tokens through token export/import. (#598)
- CLI: add XDG kind-aware config/data/state/cache paths with `GOG_HOME`, per-kind `GOG_*_DIR` overrides, and `--home` while preserving legacy auth/keyring/service-account reads. (#621, #622) — thanks @alexminza.
- Docs: add explicit `--page-width`, `--page-height`, and page margin flags to `docs write` and `docs page-layout`, keeping `--pageless` width unchanged unless requested. (#629, #630) — thanks @sebsnyk.

### Fixed

- People: fall back to token identity when `gog me` / `gog whoami` hit a disabled People API on the OAuth client project. (#460, #461)
- Docs: drop all-whitespace Markdown table header rows during Docs markdown writes, and rewrite same-document `#heading-slug` links to native Google Docs heading links after Drive markdown import. (#632, #633) — thanks @sebsnyk.
- Gmail: include attachment metadata in `gmail messages search --include-body --json` results. (#620)
- Auth: let `auth service-account set` read service account keys from stdin (`--key=-` or `--key-stdin`) or an environment variable (`--key-env`). (#600)
- Auth: serialize file-keyring reads and writes with a shared lock so concurrent `gog` processes cannot observe partial keyring entries or clobber multi-key token updates. (#597)
- Release: verify the OpenClaw Homebrew tap checkout when checking `gogcli` formula assets.

## 0.18.0 - 2026-05-22

### Added

- Docs: add `VISION.md` with project fit, discussion, and live-test merge guidance.
- Calendar: add --with-zoom / --regenerate-zoom / --remove-zoom that create, regenerate, and remove Zoom meetings and attach the join URL + meeting ID + passcode to the Calendar event description. Google's Calendar API rejects conferenceData writes asserting `conferenceSolution.key.type="addOn"` from non-Workspace-Marketplace OAuth clients, so the description-mode integration is the path that round-trips through Google's storage; trade-off is no native "Join with Zoom" conference card. (#589, #590) — thanks @alexisperumal and @mvanhorn.
- Auth: add gog zoom auth setup / doctor for Zoom S2S OAuth credential storage. (#590) — thanks @mvanhorn.
- Drive: add `--action=resolve|reopen` to `drive comments reply` and sibling `drive comments resolve|reopen` verbs (also `docs comments reopen`) to post a reply that atomically flips the parent comment's resolved state via the Drive API's `Reply.action` field. Avoids the previous workaround of `drive comments delete` (which destroys review-thread context) for batch-resolving inline doc-review feedback. (#623) — thanks @sebsnyk.
- Sheets: add `gog sheets batch-update <spreadsheetId> --data-json ...` for updating multiple value ranges in one Sheets API request. Alias: `batch`. (#601) — thanks @Tsopic.
- Docs: add `gog docs insert-page-break <docId> [--index N | --at-end] [--tab=STRING]` to insert a Google Docs page break directly via `InsertPageBreakRequest` — markdown has no native page-break construct, so this is the only path for multi-page deliverables. Aliases: `page-break`, `pb`. (#604)
- Docs: add `gog docs page-layout <docId> [--layout=pageless|pages]` to toggle the page layout of an existing Google Doc via `updateDocumentStyle` on `documentFormat.documentMode`. Sibling to the existing `--pageless` flag on `docs create`/`write`/`update` for the case where the doc was created upstream (e.g. by Drive markdown conversion) without the desired layout. Defaults to `pageless`. Aliases: `set-page-layout`, `page-setup`. (#593)
- Docs: add `--heading-level N` (1..6 shortcut) and `--named-style NAME` (full enum) to `gog docs format` so existing paragraphs can be promoted to `HEADING_1`..`HEADING_6`, `TITLE`, `SUBTITLE`, or `NORMAL_TEXT`. Both set `paragraphStyle.namedStyleType` on the existing UpdateParagraphStyle request and compose cleanly with `--alignment` / `--line-spacing`. (#605)
- Sheets: add `gog sheets reorder-tab <spreadsheetId> --tab=<name|sheetId> --to=N` to move a tab to a specific 0-based position via `updateSheetProperties` with field mask `index`. `--tab` accepts a title or a numeric sheet ID; `--to=0` is force-sent so the leftmost target reaches the wire as `"index":0`. Aliases: `move-tab`, `reorder-sheet`, `move-sheet`. (#603)
- Docs: add `gog docs insert-table <docId> --rows N --cols M [--index N | --at-end] [--values-json [[...]]] [--tab=STRING]` to insert a native Google Docs table directly via `InsertTableRequest`, bypassing the markdown writer. `--values-json` takes a JSON 2D string array whose dimensions must match `--rows`x`--cols`. Empty `--values-json` produces an empty table structure. (#602)
- Docs: `gog docs write --replace --markdown --tab=<tab>` now performs a whole-tab re-render — the targeted tab's existing body is wiped via `DeleteContentRange` and the markdown is re-rendered locally via the same Docs `batchUpdate` path used by `--append --markdown`, so other tabs are untouched. Previously this combination errored because Drive's markdown converter operates on entire documents only. (#595)

### Fixed

- Docs: make generated command references ignore local keyring config so `make ci` stays clean across developer machines.
- CLI: harden backup writes, config/credentials atomic saves, keyring write verification, line input buffering, disabled-API hints, JSON transform number handling, and untrusted-content wrapping after ClawPatch review.
- CLI: bound retry request replay buffering, recover failed async backup pushes, ignore global git commit signing in backup snapshots, and protect account manager OAuth redirects with CSRF checks.
- Release: update the Homebrew handoff to publish through `openclaw/tap`.
- Version: `gog --version` now reports an informative fallback (for example, `v0.17.0-dev`) when built from source with plain `go build` instead of returning `dev`.
- Docs: `gog docs insert` now defaults to end-of-doc when `--index` is omitted, instead of always inserting at position 1 (which silently reversed iterative inserts across multiple calls). Pass `--index 1` explicitly to keep the previous behaviour. (#606)
- Docs: `docs write --append --markdown` with three or more markdown tables in a single render no longer drifts the per-table insertion offset by one character per table — the trailing punctuation of the paragraph immediately before the third (and any subsequent) table is preserved instead of being split into a standalone paragraph after the table. (#607)
- Docs: `docs write --append --markdown` now expands inline markdown markers (`**bold**`, `*italic*`, `` `code` ``, `[link](url)`) inside table cells into character runs, matching the behaviour outside of tables — previously the markers rendered as literal characters because the table inserter bypassed the inline-formatting pass. (#608)
- Docs: markdown empty-header table rows (e.g. `|   |   |`) no longer collide with the separator detection — previously `docs write --append --markdown` swallowed both the empty header and the real `|---|---|` separator, leaving the last data row re-parsed as a literal pipe paragraph after the table. (#609)
- Docs: `docs write --append --markdown` no longer silently drops tables with `insert native table: table not found near index N`. The native-table inserter's post-write search used a ±2 code-unit window, but the Docs API's actual table StartIndex can drift further (auto-newline + placeholder paragraph combine to a several-unit shift); the search now picks the closest forward Table element with matching dimensions and a small backward tolerance instead. The `docs create --file --markdown` path was unaffected because it uses Drive's native markdown import end-to-end. (#592) — thanks @sebsnyk.
- Docs: `docs write --append --markdown` now renders bullet lists as native `BULLET` paragraphs (via `CreateParagraphBullets`) and fenced code blocks as a single contiguous shaded paragraph (joining lines with vertical-tab soft breaks). Previously bullets came through as `NORMAL_TEXT` paragraphs with a literal `•` glyph in the text run, and each code-block line became its own one-line `Courier New` paragraph with no paragraph-level background. (#594) — thanks @sebsnyk.

## 0.17.0 - 2026-05-15

### Added

- `slides create-from-markdown`: import slidey-flavored decks with per-slide YAML frontmatter (`layout:`, `content:`), `## Notes` speaker notes, Font Awesome icon shortcodes, mermaid diagrams, `::cols::`/`::col2::`/`::col3::`/`::right::` columns, and `::boxes::`/`::arrows::` icon-row blocks. New flags: `--fa-style`, `--mmdc`, `--strict`, `--keep-temp-images`, `--no-notes` — thanks @njreid.
- Calendar: add `calendar events --sort=start|end|summary|calendar` and `--order=asc|desc` so `--all` output can be returned chronologically across calendars instead of per-calendar API iteration order. Also documents `now` in the `--from`/`--to` help strings (already accepted by `timeparse`) — the relative form agents need when planning "from now on" — thanks @gado-ships-it.
- Calendar: add `calendar events --location` to include event locations in table output. Embedded newlines in the location string are collapsed so multi-line addresses still render on one row — thanks @gado-ships-it.
- Auth: add `gog auth import --client --email` with `--refresh-token-stdin`, `--refresh-token-file`, or `--refresh-token-env` for non-interactive token import without exposing secrets in argv — thanks @jcarnegie.
- Drive: add `drive share --notify` for invite targets that require a Drive notification email.
- Calendar: keep `calendar appointments` as an explicit diagnostic because the Calendar API still rejects `eventTypes=appointmentSchedule`. (#329)
- CLI: add nested `docs tabs ...` and `forms questions ...` aliases for consistent sub-item command patterns while preserving existing flat commands. (#433)
- Drive: add `drive audit sharing|user` plus guarded `drive bulk remove-public|update-role` permission operations with dry-run and confirmation support. (#336)
- Drive: add `drive labels file list|apply|remove` alongside Drive Labels API v2 discovery. (#339)
- Maps: add directions, distance matrix, geocode, and reverse-geocode commands alongside Places search/details. (#571)
- Photos: add read-only `photos list|search|get|download` for app-created Google Photos media. (#381)

### Fixed

- CLI: make mutating dry-runs for contacts, Docs, Drive, Meet, and Slides stop before auth/API calls while still validating local inputs; harden live smoke tests for self-sharing, disabled Meet, Gmail filter labels, and forced batch deletes.
- CLI: make `drive upload`, `drive bulk remove-public/update-role`, `calendar subscribe`, `docs clear`, `slides create-from-markdown`, `slides insert-text`, `slides replace-text`, `auth tokens import`, and Gmail tracking key rotation dry-runs use the standard parseable dry-run envelope without auth/API access.
- CLI: keep additional Docs write/update/delete/format/find-replace, Drive mkdir/changes, Gmail label create/modify, and Slides add/delete/replace/update-notes dry-runs offline before auth/API calls.
- CLI: give destructive Classroom, Gmail, Keep, and Tasks dry-runs stable JSON operation names and structured request payloads instead of prose `op` values with null requests.
- CLI: keep Docs tab edits, Sheets tab deletes, Drive deletes, comment deletes, auth removals, Gmail delegate/watch removals, Classroom guardian deletes, and other-contact deletes dry-run parseable without auth/API access.
- CLI: make dry-runs for Gmail label edits, Sheets table deletes, Sheets banding/conditional clears, and Forms deletes stop before auth/API calls, and make Forms dry-runs validate choice, scale, quiz, and empty update inputs locally.
- CLI: make dry-runs for Calendar secondary calendars, Forms create/publish/watch/move, Gmail label delete, Sheets table append/clear, Sheets named-range edits, Apps Script create, and Slides template creation stay offline before auth/API calls.
- Calendar: keep `calendar create/update --dry-run` with `--location-search` or `--place-id` offline before Places API lookup while still validating the requested lookup.
- CLI: make dry-runs for Admin group/user/org-unit edits, Contacts delete, Docs tab export, Drive tab download/share/unshare, and Gmail watch renew stay offline before auth/API calls; redact Admin user create passwords in dry-run output.
- Auth: keep fresh OAuth saves working even when old file-keyring token entries are unreadable, and clarify that `--services all` means all user OAuth services while Workspace-only services use service accounts.
- Auth: include Chat reaction scopes in `--services chat` and keep the generated auth scope table freshness-tested.
- Auth: keep the accounts manager bound to loopback addresses, generate callback URLs from the actual listener host, and avoid deleting renamed-account tokens before replacements are stored.
- Gmail: reject off-palette `gmail labels style` colors locally instead of forwarding an opaque Gmail API error.
- Drive: make `drive share --dry-run` stop before permission creation for user and domain shares, including `--notify`.
- Forms: make `forms create --description` apply the description with a follow-up batch update, and preserve zero-valued indexes in `forms move-question`.
- Analytics: show Analytics Admin/Data API enablement hints instead of an Admin SDK hint for GA API-disabled errors.
- Docs: make `docs find-replace --format markdown` strip inline and block Markdown markers while preserving nested bold/italic/code/link formatting in the inserted Google Doc content. (#586) — thanks @sebsnyk.
- YouTube: preserve API-key authentication when wrapping requests with the retry transport, so public `youtube`/`yt` reads no longer fail as unregistered callers. (#578) — thanks @adityarya24.
- Docs: update OAuth success/accounts GitHub links to the `openclaw/gogcli` repository. (#561)

## 0.16.0 - 2026-05-10

### Added

- Admin: expand `admin users create` with GAM-style aliases, generated passwords, suspended/archived creation, recovery contact fields, and password hash metadata; add `admin users delete` for cleanup.
- Admin: add `admin orgunits` commands to list, inspect, create, update, and delete Workspace organizational units.
- Sites: add Drive-backed `sites` commands to list, search, inspect, and open New Google Sites. (#574) — thanks @thewilloftheshadow.

- Gmail: add `gmail send --body-html-file` for sending HTML email bodies from files without shell command substitution. (#575) — thanks @toruvieI.
- YouTube: add `youtube` (alias `yt`) command group for YouTube Data API v3 — list activities, videos, playlists, comment threads, and channels; API key via config `youtube_api_key` or `GOG_YOUTUBE_API_KEY`; OAuth for `--mine` with `gog auth add ... --services youtube`. (#313) — thanks @satputekuldip.
- Forms: add quiz grading flags to `forms add-question` so choice and short-answer questions can set answer keys and point values when created. (#570) — thanks @dbernaltbn.
- Calendar: resolve event locations through Places API with `--location-search` / `--place-id`, storing the resolved Place ID in private extended properties. (#140 / #138) — thanks @salmonumbrella.
- Drive: add `drive changes` start-token/list/watch/stop commands for incremental sync and webhook automation. (#335)
- Drive: add `drive activity query` for Drive Activity API v2 audit trails with item, folder, time, and action filters. (#337)
- CLI: add `--wrap-untrusted` / `GOG_WRAP_UNTRUSTED` to mark fetched JSON/raw
  free-text fields with external untrusted-content wrappers for agent/LLM use. (#577) — thanks @VACInc.

- Forms: add `forms publish` to publish/unpublish existing forms and return the responder URL for automated form creation flows. (#565 / #564) — thanks @bogdanovich.

### Fixed

- Auth: make `auth service-account status` show `stored`, a clear missing-key message, and the exact setup hint when no service-account key is configured.
- Admin: retry the post-create state update so `admin users create --suspended` and `--archived` remain reliable while the Admin SDK finishes provisioning the new user.
- Calendar: make `calendar update --with-meet` idempotent when an event already has conference data, add explicit `--regenerate-meet`, and show `recurringEventId` in plain event output. (#576 / #573) — thanks @alexisperumal and @NodeJSmith.
- Release: fail closed when macOS signing secrets are missing and verify Darwin release assets are not ad-hoc signed, so Homebrew upgrades keep stable Keychain trust. (#569) — thanks @aaroneden.
- Auth: list one row per OAuth client when the same account is authorized under multiple clients, and let `auth list --client` filter that token bucket. (#563) — thanks @UnPractical91.
- Docs: clarify how to pass file-keyring environment into headless OpenClaw/systemd agent processes. (#566) — thanks @chsbusch-dot.
- Docs: avoid infinite loops when local Markdown parsing ends on Thai, CJK, emoji, or other multi-byte runes. (#560 / #559) — thanks @ninyawee.

## 0.15.0 - 2026-05-05

### Added
- Export exact Google API JSON when the normal CLI view is too lossy: `docs raw`, `sheets raw`, `slides raw`, `drive raw`, `gmail raw`, `calendar raw`, `people raw`, `contacts raw`, `tasks raw`, and `forms raw`, with `--pretty`, safer Drive defaults, Sheets grid-data warnings, and a raw-output security audit. (#495, #496) — thanks @karbassi.
- Audit Drive storage without changing files: `drive tree`, `drive du`, and `drive inventory` now report folder contents, sizes, and inventory data for cleanup/review workflows. (#116) — thanks @rohan-patnaik.
- Find duplicate contacts safely: `contacts dedupe` is preview-only, matches by email/phone by default, supports opt-in name matching, and emits JSON/table merge plans without applying changes. (#116) — thanks @rohan-patnaik.
- Read Gmail messages in agent-safe form: `gmail get --sanitize-content` / `--safe` and `gmail thread get --sanitize-content` return sanitized content without exposing raw Gmail payloads in JSON. (#238, #220) — thanks @urasmutlu.
- Ship official container images: release tags now publish a non-root GHCR Docker image, with file-keyring docs for container automation. (#539, #444) — thanks @HuckOps and @rdehuyss.
- Request custom Drive fields: `drive ls --fields` and `drive get --fields` pass Drive API field masks for data beyond the default JSON set. (#495) — thanks @karbassi.
- Format Google Docs from the CLI: `docs format` and plain-text `docs write` formatting flags cover fonts, colors, bold/italic/underline/strikethrough, alignment, and line spacing. (#479) — thanks @mmaghsoodnia.
- Manage Google Docs tabs: `docs add-tab`, `docs rename-tab`, `docs delete-tab`, plus tab-scoped Markdown append and find-replace flows. (#547, #541) — thanks @chopenhauer and @donbowman.
- Work with structured Google Sheets tables: `sheets table` list/get/create/delete, `sheets table append`, and header-safe `sheets table clear`. (#470) — thanks @Pedrohgv.
- Format Sheets visually: `sheets conditional-format` and `sheets banding` add rule-based formatting and alternating color banded ranges. (#378) — thanks @codBang.
- Add Meet links to existing calendar events with `calendar update --with-meet`. (#538) — thanks @alexisperumal.
- Move calendar events between calendars with `calendar move` / `calendar transfer`, including organizer changes. (#448) — thanks @markusbkoch.
- Export Gmail filters as Gmail WebUI-importable Atom XML, while keeping API JSON export via `--format json`. (#174) — thanks @gwpl.
- Build safer agent binaries with baked `agent-safe`, `readonly`, and `full` safety profiles, fail-closed command filtering, filtered help/schema output, docs, and build tooling. (#366, #239) — thanks @drewburchfield.
- Use gog from coding agents more safely with the bundled `gog` skill for JSON-first Google Workspace automation. (#353, #451) — thanks @TimPietrusky and @sluramod.

### Fixed
- Make full-mailbox backups survive large Gmail exports by promoting completed checkpoint shards into the final manifest and byte-splitting fallback message shards before GitHub rejects oversized blobs.
- Make backup exports more resumable and fault-tolerant by streaming decrypted shards, preserving Gmail Markdown mirrors, handling very large JSONL rows, and writing Markdown fallbacks for malformed MIME messages instead of aborting.
- Keep agent safety profiles harder to patch by compiling baked policies into generated hash switches instead of embedding raw allow/deny YAML strings. (#540) — thanks @drewburchfield.
- Show correct versions for `go install ...@tag` binaries by inferring module versions from Go build info when linker metadata is absent. (#545, #544) — thanks @joshavant.
- Accept the documented `calendar events list` / `ls` selector forms, including positional calendar IDs, `--cal`, `--calendars`, and `--all`. (#546) — thanks @BCudeOpenClaw.
- Keep `docs find-replace --dry-run` read-only while still reporting match counts, and allow empty replacement strings to delete matches safely. (#542) — thanks @chrismdp.

## 0.14.0 - 2026-04-28

### Added
- Backup: add `gog backup` with age-encrypted Git shards, Gmail labels/raw message export, Calendar/Contacts/Tasks/Drive metadata adapters, manifest status, full decrypt-and-verify, shard `cat`, local plaintext export, docs, and security-focused regression coverage.
- Backup: expand `gog backup push --services all` with Drive content export/download, Gmail settings, native Workspace Docs/Sheets/Slides/Form data, Apps Script projects, Chat, Classroom, best-effort optional service error shards, and plaintext Drive file export.
- Backup: extend `--services all` with Drive permissions/comments/revisions, Calendar ACL/settings/colors, contact groups, Cloud Identity groups, Workspace Admin Directory users/groups/members, Keep notes, and local Gmail message caching for resumable full-mailbox fetches.
- Backup: add `gog backup export --gmail-format markdown` for local readable Gmail mirrors with Markdown notes and extracted attachment files.
- Gmail: add `gmail messages search --body-format html` for returning HTML message bodies when `--include-body` is used. (#520) — thanks @alexknowshtml.
- Contacts: add `contacts export` for vCard 4.0 `.vcf` exports by resource, email/name search, or all contacts, including best-effort label categories. (#519, #500) — thanks @dinakars777.
- Docs: add experimental `docs export --tab` / `drive download --tab` to export a single Google Docs tab as PDF, DOCX, text, Markdown, or HTML. (#535) — thanks @johnbenjaminlewis.
- Slides: add `slides insert-text` and `slides replace-text` for editing existing slide text elements and replacing template tokens. (#521) — thanks @chrissanchez-iops.
- Drive: add `drive search --drive` and `--parent` for scoping search to a shared drive or folder. (#525) — thanks @LeanSheng.
- Calendar: add `--start-timezone` / `--end-timezone` to `calendar create` and `calendar update` for preserving named IANA event timezones when RFC3339 inputs only carry numeric offsets. (#422)
- Contacts: include birthdays in `contacts list` and `contacts search` text and JSON output. (#441)
- Auth: add `gog auth doctor` to diagnose keyring backend/password drift, unreadable file-keyring tokens, and refresh-token failures such as Workspace `invalid_rapt`. (#377, #338)
- Backup: bound individual Drive content exports with `--drive-content-timeout` so one stuck Google export records an encrypted error row instead of blocking the full backup.
- Backup: add Gmail message-list checkpoints, streaming shard construction, and stderr progress counters so full-mailbox backups can resume cleanly after interruption without keeping every raw message in RAM.
- Backup: push encrypted incomplete Gmail checkpoint commits during long cached fetches so day-scale mailbox backups have offsite progress before the final manifest is committed.
- Backup: push Gmail checkpoint commits through a single ordered background queue so cached fetches continue while GitHub uploads run.
- Slides docs: document the Markdown structure accepted by `slides create-from-markdown`. (#497)
- Google API: expose a reusable authenticated HTTP client for commands that need custom HTTP policies. (#534) — thanks @johnbenjaminlewis.

- Auth: store Google OIDC `sub` claims with OAuth tokens and migrate matching subject-keyed accounts when a Google email rename is reauthorized. (#504)
- Gmail: build outbound `Date` headers with the configured timezone so replies do not inherit a wrong host-local offset. (#514, #472) — thanks @dinakars777.
- Gmail: auto-fill draft reply subjects from the original message when `gmail drafts create --reply-to-message-id` omits `--subject`. (#488) — thanks @jbowerbir.
- Gmail: fall back to the People profile name for primary-account `From` headers when Gmail send-as settings omit a display name. (#431) — thanks @moeedahmed.
- Gmail: expose reply threading headers in default `gmail get --format metadata` output and fail explicit reply targets that cannot provide a `Message-ID`. (#528, #512) — thanks @solomonneas.
- Gmail: apply Gmail system-label filters for searches like `in:spam is:unread` so thread, message, and batch message searches do not return read spam. (#449)
- Gmail: preserve renewed watch expiration fields when a long-running `gmail watch serve` process records push delivery state after `gmail watch renew` runs separately. (#526)
- Gmail: reuse the shared paginated list runner for thread and message search so `--all`, `--page`, text, and JSON output stay consistent.
- Gmail: clarify that `gmail batch delete` is permanent and point default-scope workflows at `gmail trash`. (#151)
- Drive/Docs/Sheets/Slides: treat `--out -` as stdout for downloads and exports instead of creating `-`/`-.ext` files; reject `--json --out -` to keep byte streams parseable. (#286)
- Docs: deprecate editing-command `--tab-id` in favor of `--tab`, and resolve tab titles to canonical tab IDs before mutations. (#533) — thanks @johnbenjaminlewis.
- Docs: convert Markdown formatting for `docs write --append --markdown` instead of appending raw Markdown syntax. (#530, #272) — thanks @eric-x-liu.
- Docs: include available tab names when `docs cat --tab` / structure lookup cannot find the requested tab. (#532) — thanks @johnbenjaminlewis.
- Docs: size remote Markdown images consistently for `docs write --replace --markdown` by reusing the Docs image insertion path after Drive conversion, and return a clear error for local image paths that the Docs API cannot fetch directly. (#518) — thanks @vinothd-oai.
- Drive: print large upload progress to stderr while keeping JSON output parseable. (#529)
- Drive: include `hasThumbnail` and `thumbnailLink` in `drive ls`, `drive search`, and `drive get` JSON responses. (#486) — thanks @gtapps.
- Drive: include `driveId` in `drive ls`, `drive search`, and `drive get` field masks so Shared Drive files can be identified in JSON output. (#524) — thanks @LeanSheng.
- Calendar: display `calendar events` times and JSON local fields in the calendar timezone instead of preserving arbitrary event offsets. (#493)
- Email tracking: add versioned tracking-key rotation so new pixels use the current key while old tracking ids keep decrypting through prior keys. (#293)
- Email tracking: deduplicate repeated pixel opens and cap recorded opens per IP per hour to reduce D1 abuse from replay or high-volume requests. (#294)
- Email tracking: add daily Worker retention cleanup for open rows older than 90 days and cap admin `/opens` responses at 500 rows. (#292)
- Email tracking: make `gmail track setup --deploy` reusable with existing D1 databases and valid temporary Wrangler configs.
- Backup: split Gmail checkpoint commits by row count and plaintext byte size so large messages stay below GitHub's blob limit.
- Secrets: time out macOS Keychain read/write/list operations with a clear recovery hint instead of hanging indefinitely when a permission prompt cannot surface. (#515, #513) — thanks @sardoru.
- Secrets: encode file-backend key names so stored tokens work on Windows, while still reading/removing legacy raw entries. (#527, #502) — thanks @solomonneas.
- CLI: show direct Google Cloud API enablement links and matching `auth add --services ...` hints when Google returns API-not-enabled errors.
- Install docs: document Windows release ZIP/PATH setup and clarify that source builds require the Go version declared in `go.mod`, not Ubuntu 24.04's Go 1.22 package. (#157, #135)
- Auth docs: clarify that consumer Gmail refresh tokens expire after 7 days when the OAuth app remains External + Testing, and that publishing the personal OAuth app is the long-lived-token path. (#121)
- CI: pin GitHub Actions workflow dependencies to immutable commit SHAs. (#288)

- Auth: persist rotated OAuth refresh tokens returned during API calls so later commands keep working without re-auth. (#373) — thanks @joshp123.
- Auth: allow pure service-account mode when the configured subject matches the service account itself, instead of forcing domain-wide delegation impersonation. (#399) — thanks @carrotRakko.
- Auth: keep Keep-only service-account fallback isolated to Keep commands so other Google services do not accidentally pick it up. (#414) — thanks @jgwesterlund.

- Gmail: `gmail archive|read|unread|trash` convenience commands now honor `--dry-run` and emit action-specific dry-run ops. (#385) — thanks @yeager.
- Gmail: retry transient `failedPrecondition` errors during `gmail filters create` and return the existing matching filter on duplicate creates, so reruns stay idempotent.
- Sheets: harden `sheets format` against `boarders` typo (JSON and field mask), with clearer error messages. (#284) — thanks @nilzzzzzz.
- Sheets: force-send empty note values so `sheets update-note --note ''` reliably clears notes via the API. (#341) — thanks @Shehryar.
- Contacts: send the required `copyMask` when deleting "other contacts", avoiding People API 400 errors. (#384) — thanks @rbansal42.
- Groups: include required label filters in transitive group searches so `groups list` doesn’t 400 on Cloud Identity. (#315) — thanks @salmonumbrella.
- Sheets: make `sheets metadata --plain` emit real TSV tab delimiters, with regression coverage for plain tabular sheet output. (#298) — thanks @mahsumaktas.
- CLI: show root help instead of a parse error when `gog` is run with no arguments. (#342) — thanks @cstenglein.
- CLI: include the current partial token in fish shell completion so `gog __complete` sees the active word under the cursor. (#123) — thanks @GiGurra.

### Security & Reliability
- Secrets: verify keyring token writes by reading them back, so macOS headless Keychain failures return an actionable error instead of silently storing 0 bytes. (#270) — thanks @zerone0x.
- Secrets: respect empty `GOG_KEYRING_PASSWORD` (treat set-to-empty as intentional; avoids headless prompts). (#269) — thanks @zerone0x.
- Security: require confirmation before public Drive shares, Gmail forwarding filters, and Gmail delegate grants in no-input/agent flows. (#317) — thanks @salmonumbrella.
- Security: redact stored Gmail watch webhook bearer tokens in `gmail watch status` text and JSON output unless `--show-secrets` is set. (#136) — thanks @paveg.

### Tooling & Docs

  - `--output=text` (tab-separated lists on stdout) and `--output=json` (JSON on stdout).
  - Human hints/progress/errors go to stderr.
- Colorized output in rich TTY (`--color=auto|always|never`), automatically disabled for JSON output.
- Gmail features:
  - Search threads, show thread, generate web URLs.
  - Label listing/get (including counts) and thread label modify.
  - Send mail (supports reply headers + attachments).
  - Drafts: list/get/create/send/delete.
- Calendar features:
  - List calendars, list ACL rules.
  - List/get/create/update/delete events and free/busy queries.
- Drive features:
  - List/search/get files, download (including Google Docs export), upload, mkdir, delete, move, rename.

- Contacts / People API features:
  - Contacts list/search/get/create/update/delete.
  - “Other contacts” list/search.
  - Workspace directory list/search (Workspace accounts only).
- Developer experience:
  - Formatting via `gofumpt` + `goimports` (and `gofmt` implicitly) using `make fmt` / `make fmt-check`.
  - Linting via pinned `golangci-lint` with repo config.
  - Tests using stdlib `testing` + `httptest`, with steadily increased unit coverage.
  - GitHub Actions CI running format checks, tests, and lint.
  - `make` builds `./bin/gog` for local dev (`make && ./bin/gog auth add you@gmail.com`).

### Notes / Known Limitations

- Importing tokens into macOS Keychain may require a local (GUI) session; headless/SSH sessions can fail due to Keychain user-interaction restrictions.
- Workspace directory commands require a Google Workspace account; `@gmail.com` accounts will not work for directory endpoints.
